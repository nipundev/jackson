## üöÄ Getting Started with SAML Jackson

Please star ‚≠ê the repo if you want us to continue developing and improving SAML Jackson! üòÄ

Streamline your web application's authentication with Jackson, an SSO service supporting SAML and OpenID Connect protocols. Beyond enterprise-grade Single Sign-On, it also supports Directory Sync via the SCIM 2.0 protocol for automatic user and group provisioning/de-provisioning.

There are two ways to integrate SAML Jackson into an application. Depending on your use case, you can choose either of them. <br>

1. [separate service](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/deploy/#as-a-separate-service) (Next.js application) Admin Portal out of the box for managing SSO and Directory Sync connections.
2. [NPM library](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/deploy/#as-a-separate-service) as an embedded library in your application.

SAML/OIDC SSO service

Jackson implements the SAML login flow as an OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect flow, abstracting away all the complexities of the SAML protocol. Integrate SAML with just a few lines of code. We also now support OpenID Connect providers.

Try our hosted demo showcasing the SAML SP login flow [here](https://saml-demo.boxyhq.com), no SAML configuration required thanks to our [Mock SAML](https://mocksaml.com) service.

## Documentation

## Directory Sync

SAML Jackson also supports Directory Sync based on the SCIM 2.0 protocol.

Directory sync helps organizations automate the provisioning and de-provisioning of their users. As a result, it streamlines the user lifecycle management process by saving valuable organizational hours, creating a single truth source of the user identity data, and facilitating them to keep the data secure.

## Observability

We support first-class observability on the back of OpenTelemetry, refer [here](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/observability) for more details.

## SBOM Reports (Software Bill Of Materials)

We support SBOM reports, refer [here](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/sbom) for more details.

## Container Signing and Verification

We support container image verification using cosign, refer [here](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/container-signing) for more details.

### Development Setup

#### Database

To get up and running, we have a [docker-compose setup](_dev/docker-compose.yml) that will spawn all the supported databases. Ensure that the docker daemon is running on your machine and then run: `npm run dev-dbs`. In case you need a fresh start, destroy the docker containers using: `npm run dev-dbs-destroy` and run: `npm run dev-dbs`.

#### Development server

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env.local` and populate the values. Have a look at https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/deploy/env-variables for the available environment variables.

Run the dev server:

```zsh
# Install the packages
npm run custom-install
# Start the server
npm run dev
```

#### End-to-End (E2E) tests

Create a `.env.test.local` file and populate the values. To execute the tests run:

```zsh
npm run test:e2e
```
